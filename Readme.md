I am aware that there are many things that you can't do with Zöglfrex (see the Known Limitations above), but most of them will get implemented over time.
However, you can help by testing Zöglfrex, reporting bugs in the Issues tab and therefore making this software more stable.
Please check this points before creating an Issue:
1. First of all, make sure you're using the latest version of Zöglfrex.
    In case you haven't, upgrade Zöglfrex and check if the problem still occurs.
2. Always check the Changelog and the open Issues.
    Did someone report this bug yet? 
3. Try to reduce the number of steps needed for recreating the bug to a minimal amount.
    If possible, provide step-by-step instructions.
4. Open a new Issue and describe the problem as accurate as possible.
