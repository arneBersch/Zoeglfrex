# Zöglfrex
Zöglfrex is a Free and Open Source stage lighting software.

It currently only runs on Ubuntu Linux, however, Appimage and Windows support is planned, too.

## Features
- command line interface
- sACN (ANSI E1.31) DMX output
- included hardware abstraction layer
- multi level IDs like 1.2.3.4.5

As Zöglfrex is still a very young software, only the most basic functions are implemented yet.

## Known Limitations
- only one DMX Universe
- DMX Output only via sACN (ANSI E1.31)
- only Dimmer and RGB channels supported
- only one Cue can be played back simultanously
- no effects possible
- only English UI, no other languages supported yet
