## Item commands
These commands can be executed with all types of Items (Models, Fixtures, Groups, Intensities, Colors, Raws, Cues).

### Item Attribute 0 Set (Move / Set ID)
This command changes Attribute 0 (the ID) of the selected Item.

Please note that this command only makes sense for one selected Item as two Items of the same type and with the same ID are not allowed.

So, for example for setting the ID of Model 1 to 2, you would need the following command:
```
Model 1 Attribute 0 Set 2
```

### Item Attribute 1 Set (Label)
This command changes Attribute 1 (the Label) of the selected Items, for example:
```
Model 1 + 2 Attribute 1 Set
```
The command will open a popup window where you can insert the Label text for those Models.

### Item Set Item (Copy)
This command can be used for copying Items, for example:
```
Model 2 + 3 Set Model 1
```
This command will copy all the Attributes of Model 1 to Model 2 and 3.

### Item Set - (Delete)
This command deletes Items, for example:
```
Model 1 + 2 Set -
```
This command will remove Model 1 and 2.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please note that deleting Items can affect other Items to:
> - When deleting a Model, the Model Attribute of all Fixtures which used this Model are set to None (Dimmer).
> - When deleting a Model, the Model Exceptions for these Model are deleted in all Attributes.
> - When deleting a Fixture, the Fixture is removed from all Groups.
> - When deleting a Fixture, the Fixture Exceptions for these Fixture are deleted in all Attributes.
> - When deleting a Group, the Group will be removed from all Cues.
> - When deleting an Intensity, it will be removed from all Effects and Cues.
> - When deleting a Color, it will be removed from all Effects and Cues.
> - When deleting a Position, it will be removed from all Effects and Cues.
> - When deleting a Raw, it will be removed from all Effects and Cues.
> - When deleting an Effect, it will be removed from all Cues.

## Models
If no Model Attribute is given, the standard Attribute 2 will be used.

If no Model ID is given, the Model of the current Fixture will be used.

### Model Attribute 2 Set (Channels)
This command doesn't take a value. Instead, it will open a popup where you can insert the Model's channels. These channels are currently supported:
- D (Dimmer)
- d (Dimmer fine)
- R (Red)
- r (Red fine)
- G (Green)
- g (Green fine)
- B (Blue)
- b (Blue fine)
- W (White)
- w (White fine)
- C (Cyan)
- c (Cyan fine)
- M (Magenta)
- m (Magenta fine)
- Y (Yellow)
- y (Yellow fine)
- P (Pan)
- p (Pan fine)
- T (Tilt)
- t (Tilt fine)
- 0 (DMX value 0)
- 1 (DMX value 255)

So, for example, if you want to add a generic RGB Model, you need to type 'RGB' into the popup.

### Model Attribute 3.1 Set (Pan Range)
If your Model supports the Pan Attribute, you should set its Pan Range so that Positions are rendered correctly.
The Pan Range is given in Degree.

### Model Attribute 3.2 Set (Tilt Range)
If your Model supports the Tilt Attribute, you should set its Tilt Range so that Positions are rendered correctly.
The Tilt Range is given in Degree.

## Fixtures
If no Fixture Attribute is given, the standard Attribute 3 will be used.

If no Fixture ID is given, the current Fixture in the current Group will be used.
If no Fixture is currently selected, all Fixtures of the current Group will be selected.
You can select the current Fixture of the current Group with the left and right arrow keys or like this:
```
Fixture 1
```

### Fixture Attribute 2 Set (Model)
This command sets the Model of the selected Fixtures:
```
Fixture 1 + 2 Attribute 2 Set Model 3
```
Every new Fixture's Model is set to None.
This means that the Fixture is a simple Dimmer.
You can also remove the Model from a Fixture, setting the Model Attribute to None/Dimmer again:
```
Fixture 1 Attribute 2 Set -
```

### Fixture Attribute 3.1 Set (Address)
This command sets the DMX address of the selected Fixtures.

Every new Fixture is patched to address 0.
This means that it won't output any DMX signal but can still be used for programming.
This is great if you know your Fixture rig but not how it's patched.

After every (successful) command, Zöglfrex will check your rig for DMX patch conflicts.

### Fixture Attribute 3.2 Set (Universe)
This command sets the sACN universe of the selected Fixtures.

After every (successful) command, Zöglfrex will check your rig for DMX patch conflicts.

### Fixture Attribute 4.1 Set (X Position)
This command sets the X Position of the Fixture in the 2D View.

### Fixture Attribute 4.2 Set (Y Position)
This command sets the Y Position of the Fixture in the 2D View.

### Fixture Attribute 5.1 Set (Rotation)
This command sets the Rotation of the Fixture.

You only need to change this Attribute if your Fixture's pan in the real world is different compared to the one in the 2D View.


### Fixture Attribute 5.2 Set (Invert Pan)
This command is needed if your Fixture's pan rotates into the wrong direction compared with the 2D View.

## Groups
If no Group Attribute is given, the standard Attribute 2 will be used.

If no Group ID is given, the ID of the currently selected Group will be used.
You can select the current Group with the up and down arrow keys or like this:
```
Group 1
```

### Group Attribute 2 Set (Fixtures)
This command takes the Fixtures which you want to add to the Group:
```
Group 1 Attribute 2 Set Fixture 1.1 + 1.2 + 1.3
```
You can also give no Fixture IDs which would result in an empty Group:
```
Group 1 Attribute 2 Set
```
You can also add Fixtures to Groups without overwriting all the Fixtures like this:
```
Group 1 Attribute 2 Set + Fixture 1.4 + 1.5
```

## Intensities
If no Itensity Attribute is given, the standard Attribute 2 will be used.

If no Intensity ID is given, the ID of the Intensity of the currently selected Group in the current Cue will be used.

### Intensity Attribute 2 Set (Dimmer)
This command sets the Dimmer Attribute to the selected Intensities:
```
Intensity 1 + 2 Attribute 2 Set 75
```
Please note that the value is given in percent.

You can also define exception values for Models and Fixtures:
```
Intensity 1 + 2 Attribute 2 Model 7 Set 80
Intensity 1 + 2 Attribute 2 Fixture 5 Set 70
```
These values will replace the standard values if the Fixtures or the Models match.
You can also remove the exception values again:
```
Intensity 1 + 2 Attribute 2 Model 7 Set -
Intensity 1 + 2 Attribute 2 Fixture 5 Set -
```

It is also possible to set the difference of the Intensity:
```
Intensity 1 Attribute 2 Set + 10
Intensity 2 Attribute 2 Set + - 5
```
The first command will increase the Dimmer value of Intensity 1 by 10 percent.
The second command will reduce the Dimmer value of Intensity 2 by 5 percent.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please note that this command won't work as it tries to set the Dimmer to -10 percent instead of reducing it by 10 percent:
> ```
> Intensity 2 Attribute 2 Set - 10
> ```

## Colors
If no Color Attribute is given, the standard Attribute 2 will be used.

If no Color ID is given, the ID of the Color of the currently selected Group in the current Cue will be used.

### Color Attribute 2 Set (Hue)
This command sets the Hue Attribute of the selected Colors.
The value is given in degree.

For this Attribute, you can also give Model and Fixture exceptions or set a difference, just like with Intensity Attribute 2.

If no Raw IDs are given, the IDs of the Raws of the currently selected Group in the current Cue will be used.

### Raw Attribute 2.x Set (Channel Values)
This command sets the value of channel x in the selected Raws:
```
Raw 1 + 2 Attribute 2.7 Set 213
```
This example would set channel 7 of the Fixtures the Raw is applied to to the DMX value 213.

The channel x has to be between 1 and 512.
The value has to be between 0 and 255.

You can also give value exceptions for Models or Fixtures:
```
Raw 1 Attribute 2.4 Fixture 3 Set 200
Raw 2 Attribute 2.6 Fixture 5 Set 150
```
It is also possible to remove one channel or all channels of a Fixture or Model again:

## Selecting Items
There are some useful tricks for selecting items using IDs.
You can use these whenever you can enter multiple IDs.

### Combining IDs with +
You can combine multiple IDs with +:
```
Intensity 1 + 2.1 + 1.7 Set -
```

### Combining IDs with -
You can remove IDs from the selection like this:
```
Intensity 1.1 Thru .8 - 1.4 Thru .7 Set -
```
This command will only remove the IDs 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.8.

### IDs ending with .
This syntax is useful when you want to select all IDs with the same beginning.
However, please note that this command can only select already existing IDs, so you can't use it for Items which don't exist yet!
If they existed, this command would select Intensities 1, 1.1 or any other Intensity with an ID starting with a '1.'.
```
Intensity 1. Set -
```

### All items with .
You can simply select all items using a period.
This command, for example, deletes all existing intensities:
```
Intensity . Set -
```

### Selecting multiple items with Thru .
You can also select multiple IDs with Thru.
This command would select the Intensity IDs 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11.
```
Intensity 1.9 Thru .11 Set -
```
This command deleted the Intensity IDs 1, 2, 3:
```
Intensity 1 Thru .3 Set -
```

### Selecting multiple Items with Thru
You can also select all Items in a range like this:
```
Intensity 1.1 Thru 2.3 Set -
```
This command deletes all Intensities starting with Intensity 1.1 and ending with Intensity 2.3.

## Control Panel
The Control panel can be used to control the values of the current Group or Fixture:
When selecting a Cue and a Group, you can see and change the Dimmer of the current Intensity, the Hue and Saturation of the current Color and the Pan and Tilt of the current Position.
When you now also select a Fixture, not the standard value but instead the value for this Fixture will be changed.
So, for example, if your current Intensity holds a Dimmer exception for the current Fixture, rotating the Dial will change this exception.
> [!CAUTION]
> Please note that the precision of the dials cannot be smaller than 1.
> When you need a more precise control, you can of course still set the values with the Terminal.
